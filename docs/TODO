Interdomain support:

A) Initial config:
1) Once a switch connects, check if its DPID is listed in the sdntrace.conf inter-domain.locals
2) If so, go to each domain and look for my dpid in the local attribute
3) If found, get the color variable. Use the variable.split(',')[1] as a color
4) Push a specific higher priority flow with the port in local and the color

B) Starts an inter-domain trace:
Tracer:77
1) If timeout is reached, assert switch.is_boundary, True
2) Then switch.match_flow and if result != 0
2) prepare and send an inter-domain probe

C) Receives an inter-domain trace:

Change the process_packetIn to
